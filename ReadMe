# 🚨 GraphGuard – AI-Powered Fraud Detection via Graph Neural Networks  
*Smart, Scalable, and Secure Fraud Detection for the Financial Age*

> 📌 Submission for **Cyfuture AI Hackathon 1.0**  
> Track: **Finance – Fraud Detection** | Status: *Pitch Stage (Prototype coming post Round 1)*

---

## 📖 Overview

**GraphGuard** is a next-generation fraud detection platform that leverages **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model and detect sophisticated fraudulent behaviors in financial systems. Unlike traditional systems that treat each transaction in isolation, GraphGuard constructs a **relational graph** connecting accounts, devices, locations, and transactions – allowing it to catch hidden patterns, organized fraud rings, and collusion strategies.

> 🚀 Our vision is to create a modular, GPU-accelerated fraud detection system that’s explainable, real-time, and adaptable across financial platforms.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Fraudsters today use complex, multi-hop strategies to bypass traditional detection systems. Conventional machine learning models often:
- Operate on flat tabular data.
- Miss relational and structural patterns.
- Generate high false positives.

### GraphGuard solves this by:
- Treating fraud as a **network problem**.
- Using **GNNs** to learn deep patterns of interaction.
- Scoring each transaction based on its **structural and behavioral context**.

## 💡 Key Features (Proposed)

✅ **Graph Neural Networks** for fraud detection  
✅ **Hybrid Learning**: Combine GNN embeddings with tabular ML (e.g. XGBoost)  
✅ **Real-Time Scoring** for incoming transactions  
✅ **Interactive Dashboard** to visualize fraud clusters  
✅ **GPU-accelerated training and inference** on AWS SageMaker (via Cyfuture)

## 🧠 Architecture (Planned)

1. **Transaction Graph Construction**  
   Accounts, devices, and IPs are nodes. Transactions are edges.  
2. **Graph Embedding via GNNs**  
   Learn fraud patterns over the network using GraphSAGE or GAT.  
3. **Classifier Integration**  
   Feed graph embeddings + transaction features into XGBoost.  
4. **Fraud Scoring + Visualization**  
   Streamlit dashboard to show transaction risk + graph view.

## 📊 Dataset

We’ll be using the public [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle for initial prototyping, with future plans to adapt to multi-party data or synthetic streaming sources.

## 🌍 Potential Impact

> 🎯 The global AI fraud detection market is projected to grow to **$65B+ by 2034**.  
GraphGuard has the potential to become a **commercial SaaS** platform for:
- Banks & digital wallets
- E-commerce marketplaces
- Crypto exchanges
- Insurance and loan platforms

Post-hackathon, GraphGuard can evolve into a **real-time fraud analytics engine** with explainable AI and federated learning across institutions.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 🔁 **Kafka Stream Integration** for live transaction monitoring  
- 🧠 **Explainability Layer** using LLMs (e.g. "Why was this flagged?")  
- 🤝 **Federated Training** across multiple financial institutions  
- 🔐 **Scalable SaaS APIs** with modular deployment
